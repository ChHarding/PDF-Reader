#Read Me File for PDF File Reader

Turn in link to github on Canvas and add to readme file on github

###Intro style

Welcome to my first Python app ever! This is a simple app that allows users to upload a PDF and the app will extract the text. Feel free to use my app or copy the app as a basis to build something better!

Here is the [Link](https://github.com/kirwilso/PDF-Reader/blob/master/PDF%20Reader%20App.py) to my app in Github.

###Instructions 
1. Clone and download the app
2. Run the code on your preferred source code editor 
3. Click the "Browse" button to upload a PDF
4. Select the PDF you want to extract text from 

Thats it!




Your Readme.md should have images (screenshots, graphs, etc.) This don't have to be super high-res and should be put in a subfolder (img or docs/img if you are going with a docs folder in your project)

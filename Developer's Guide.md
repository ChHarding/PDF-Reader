# Developer's Guide for PDF File Reader 
Add this to the doc folder in Github and hand in on Canvas

###Overview (in which you can re-use material from your sketch or the user's guide)

Some text here 


###Condensed version of the final(!) planning specs, i.e. which parts of the initial specs are actually currently implemented. 

some text here 

###Install/deployment/admin issues:
Assume that the developer has already read your user's guide, knows how to run your app and has your project installed. If there are additional things that the dev (but not the user) needs to do or know (e.g. to run as admin, configure something first, install other stuff, deploy the server in a specific way, watch out for that) - this is the place to mention them!  

###(End) User interaction and flow through your code ("walkthrough")
Start be a brief(!) recap of what the flow of the user interaction is. If you didn't talk about the UX aspects earlier, mention them here. This should include screenshots where needed.
Now, think about what happens at each step of the flow in your code. Describe, which classes, functions, etc. are involved. You can be as specific as you like here, but assume that the dev is also looking at your code while reading this, so no need to literally "cite" code, unless you think it's a vital snippet.
However, should certainly mention the names of classes, functions (and in which module they can be found) and any hierarchies that are put  into (class inheritance, multi-level modules (packages), etc.)
It maybe be useful to use graphics to illustrate some aspects of your explanation. This could be something like class diagrams or flow diagrams or even just simple tables.

###Known Issues: You should mention any issues you know about (or suspect)
Minor: anything that's a minor bug (non-breaking) that could easily be fixed given some time
Major: anything that will break, how to possible work around it and maybe how to fix it
(These could also come up in a user-centric, UX, UI context!)


###Future work:
Here you can offer some insights into how your project could be expanded. Maybe there were some points in your initial spec that you didn't get to. Or maybe, during development, you found that you could also do something cool ... but didn't have the time or resources to do it.
